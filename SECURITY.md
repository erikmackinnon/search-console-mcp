Older versions may not receive patches. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately:

Email: saurabhsharma2u@gmail.com

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigation (if known)

You will receive acknowledgment within a reasonable timeframe.

## Security Model

Search Console MCP is designed as a local-first CLI tool with the following security principles:

### 1. OAuth-Based Authentication

- Uses OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow
- Requests minimal scope (`webmasters.readonly`)
- Does not request write access to Google services
- Does not collect Google account passwords

Users authenticate directly with Google.

---

### 2. Local Token Storage

OAuth tokens are stored locally on the user’s device.

Primary storage:
- macOS: Keychain
- Windows: Credential Manager
- Linux: Secret Service / libsecret

Fallback storage (if secure vault unavailable):
- Encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Machine-bound key derivation
- File permissions restricted to current user (600)

Only minimal data is stored:
- `refresh_token`
- Expiry metadata

Access tokens are short-lived and not permanently stored unless necessary.

---

### 3. No Central Data Collection

Search Console MCP:

- Does not operate a backend server
- Does not transmit user data to the developer
- Does not collect analytics on user Search Console data

All API communication occurs directly between the user’s machine and Google’s APIs.

---

## Security Boundaries

The primary security boundary is the protection of OAuth refresh tokens.

If an attacker gains:

- Full access to the user’s operating system account
- Administrative access to the machine

Then local security protections may be bypassed. This risk is inherent to all CLI-based applications.

---

## Revocation

Users may revoke application access at any time via their Google Account security settings.

Upon revocation:
- Stored refresh tokens become invalid
- Further API access will fail

Users may also run logout commands to remove locally stored credentials.

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will make reasonable efforts to:

- Investigate reported issues
- Patch confirmed vulnerabilities
- Credit reporters (if desired)

Security is a priority, especially around OAuth and credential handling.
