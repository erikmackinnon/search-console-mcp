**Effective Date:** 2026-02-01

Search Console MCP is a local command-line (CLI) tool that connects to a user’s Google Search Console account to retrieve performance data.

---

## 1. Data Access

Search Console MCP requests the following Google OAuth scope:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly`

This scope provides **read-only access** to Google Search Console data.

The application:
- Does not request write access.
- Does not modify Search Console data.
- Does not access unrelated Google services.

---

## 2. Data Storage

Search Console MCP operates entirely on the user’s local machine.

- OAuth tokens (including refresh tokens) are stored locally.
- Tokens are stored using the operating system’s secure credential storage when available (e.g., Keychain, Credential Manager, Secret Service).
- If a fallback storage file is used, it is encrypted and restricted to the local user.

No Search Console data is transmitted to or stored on any external server controlled by the developer.

---

## 3. Data Sharing

Search Console MCP:

- Does not sell user data.
- Does not share user data with third parties.
- Does not transmit Search Console data to the developer.

All API requests are made directly from the user’s device to Google’s servers.

---

## 4. Security

The application follows industry best practices:

- OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow
- Minimal read-only scopes
- Secure local token storage
- Strict file permissions (where applicable)

Users may revoke access at any time via their Google Account permissions page.

---

## 5. User Control

Users may:

- Log out to remove locally stored credentials.
- Revoke access through Google Account settings.
- Stop using the application at any time.
