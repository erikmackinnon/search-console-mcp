The Analytics tools are the foundation of your SEO agent's knowledge. They allow you to pull basic data or perform complex time-series analysis.

## Core Tools

### `query_analytics` (Google) & `bing_analytics_query` (Bing)
These are your primary tools for getting raw keyword data. They support filtering and dimension grouping.
*   **When to use:** When you need a specific list of keywords, pages, or country-level data.
*   **Best for:** "List the top 10 keywords for the last 30 days."

### `compare_periods` (Google) & `bing_analytics_compare_periods` (Bing)
Calculates the delta between two time windows.
*   **When to use:** When you need to see if you are growing or shrinking.
*   **Best for:** "Compare this week's performance to last week."

## Advanced Analysis

### `analytics_time_series` (Google) & `bing_analytics_time_series` (Bing)
The "brain" of our analytics suite. It calculates rolling averages (to smooth out weekend dips), detects seasonality, and provides simple forecasting.
*   **When to use:** To understand long-term trends or identify the exact day a drop started.
*   **What problem it solves:** Distinguishing between a "bad day" and a "downward trend."

### `analytics_drop_attribution` (Google) & `bing_analytics_drop_attribution` (Bing)
Correlates traffic drops with known algorithm updates or device-specific issues.
*   **When to use:** When you see a sudden decline.
*   **What problem it solves:** Instantly tells you if a drop coincides with a Core Update.
