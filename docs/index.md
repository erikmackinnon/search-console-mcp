# SEO IQ for AI Agents

Welcome to the documentation for **search-console-mcp**. This is not just a data connector; it's a bridge between the vast performance data of Google Search Console and the reasoning capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Why MCP + SEO?

In the age of AI agents, data is only as good as the tools that process it. Standard API integrations often overwhelm models with raw JSON, leading to hallucinations or missed insights. 

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** allows us to provide AI agents with specific, deterministic tools that perform complex SEO calculations before the model even begins to reason. This approach ensures:

*   **Accuracy:** LLMs don't have to "guess" averages or trends; the tools calculate them.
*   **Efficiency:** Agents get exactly what they need to solve a specific problem.
*   **Confidence:** Every finding is based on standard SEO methodologies, not stochastic associations.

## Who is this for?

*   **Indie Hackers & Founders:** Automate your weekly SEO reviews without hiring a consultant.
*   **SEO Professionals:** Build custom agents that can investigate drops or find opportunities across hundreds of properties.
*   **AI Developers:** Integrate high-quality SEO data into your agents with a standardized protocol.

## Core Philosophy

We believe in **deterministic intelligence**. Our tools don't just "get data"; they detect cannibalization, identify striking distance keywords, and attribute traffic drops. We provide the *brains*, you provide the *agent*.

## 🚀 Magic Prompts

Try these prompts with your favorite AI agent (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to see the intelligence engine in action.

### 🕵️ The Traffic Detective
> "My traffic dropped this week compared to last. Use the anomaly detection and time-series tools to find exactly when the drop started and which pages are responsible."

### 🎯 The "Striking Distance" Hunter
> "Find keywords where I'm ranking in positions 8-15 but have at least 1,000 impressions. These are my best opportunities for a quick traffic boost."

### ⚔️ The Cannibalization Cleaner
> "Check for keyword cannibalization. Are there any queries where two or more of my pages are competing and splitting the traffic?"

### 📊 The Weekly Executive Review
> "Run a full SEO health check for my site. Segment the results by Brand vs. Non-Brand and give me 3 high-impact actions for next week."
