# Security Overview

Search Console MCP is designed with a security-first architecture appropriate for a local CLI application.

---

## OAuth Model

The application uses OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow.

- Users authenticate directly with Google.
- The application never receives user passwords.
- Only read-only Search Console scope is requested.

---

## Token Storage

OAuth tokens are stored locally on the user’s device.

Primary storage:
- macOS: Keychain
- Windows: Credential Manager
- Linux: Secret Service / libsecret

Fallback storage:
- Encrypted file using AES-256-GCM
- Machine-bound key derivation
- File permissions restricted to the current user

Only minimal token data is stored:
- `refresh_token`
- Expiry metadata

---

## Data Handling

Search Console MCP:

- Does not operate a backend server.
- Does not transmit user data to the developer.
- Does not collect analytics about user data.

All API communication occurs directly between the user’s device and Google’s APIs.

---

## Revocation

Users may revoke access at any time via their Google Account security settings.

After revocation, stored tokens become invalid.
